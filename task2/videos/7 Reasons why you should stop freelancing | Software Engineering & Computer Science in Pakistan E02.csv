zoh ahs,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqNpmWbR2-dFj4N-0BAAe7EKWN8lbNoMGrko8A=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,1 year ago,6,Mentorship is the key 1 million $ factor. I left programming back in School in 2020 as I couldn't find anybody  and teachers were busy churning out graduates to flood the market with a tictactoe project made in C and C++ which could be copied off the internet. Really amazes me they  played around with so many futures of their student just to get paycheck at the end of the month!

I had absolutely ZERO insight of the technical industry in Pakistan, as it isn't discussed much. But this playlist is REALLY helping me get an insight look of the local tech industry

Tysm for this Zubair ️ you're helping many students by doing this"

Anish Zahoor,,2 years ago,0,"For a fresh grad, in the current market situation, should he go for a company that is large-scale and pays well or for a company that has a small employee count and pays relatively less than what is being paid out there to the freshers."
Muhammad Aashir,,2 years ago (edited),1,"I have a question Ehmad, would be glad if you briefly answer it.
I have seen some fresh graduates who combine to make a team of 4-5 people and they start their own company. Behind the scene what is basically happening is they are taking online projects (Freelancing) and portray  themselves as a company rather than a single entity. What do you think about it. Is it effective and good strategy keeping in view growth, sustainability and revenue stream (which is quite high in this case) of each individual?"

اگر کوئی شخص سیکھنے کے مرحلے کو ساتھ لیے چلتا رہے فریلانسنگ کے ساتھ Slow and Steady
اس کے بارے میں آپکی آراء کیا ہونگی۔ جہاں تک میرا ایک تجزیہ ہے کہ آپ ایک مدت کے لیے کسی اچھے سافٹ ویئر ہاؤس کو جوائن کر لیتے ہیں جہاں آپ مناسب لوگوں کے ساتھ کنکشن بنانے میں کامیاب رہتے ہیں تو وہ زندگی بھر آپکے ساتھ چلیں گے چاہے وہ لوگ ہوں یا انکا experience۔۔ اور مرحلہ وار سیکھنے کا عمل بھی جاری رہے گا۔۔"
