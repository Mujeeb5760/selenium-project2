I am 6th sem student doing cs and doing my best to work in software industry to pursue my dreams... But i am doing my degree in tier 3 college... Watch all of your interviews and vidoes you only invited Fast and nust graduated students .... It's request to invite Tier 3 college students who excel in his field like Nust and Fast students with in 2 to 3 years...it's helps alot to me and others students who demotivate by thinking that they don't get admission in this universities

Everyone is rushing for CS SE nowadays, jisko 3 4 saal phely koi pouchta nahi tha.. ab merit is so high.. So we think There will be Saturation in this Field in 2026-2027, this means Less opportunities, difficult situations.. What you think? 

Please make video on this topic soon. Another thing is You say there's everything is in Internet. We Don't know Where to start? It's easy for you to say but difficult for us. Explain the pathway. 
Please Reply :) ️"
