Anonymous,,7 months ago,0,"I appreciate your work, I'm a graduate in Zoology and I was studying biology as my major since last 8 years but now after completing my 16 education I want to switch, I always wanted to be in computer science filed but I'm confused like what to choose, to start my journey in the filed of Cs I have to choose between a web design and development degree or a simple computer science degree ( although I have checked the complete course outline of these two from university's web, they have exactly the same course scheme except in semester we'll study few things like mysql, php, etc in web development and we'll study maths and geometry in the Cs course) , both of them are pre-graduate  degrees consisting of 2 years time span and after this I want to go for a bachelor's degree of a software engineer or just a bachelor in computer science It'll be really helpful if you could give a hint of what path I should choose"
