This podcast is really very helpful for a person like me, I hope I'll come out my career block soon by working hard and improving  the skills mentioned by you guys. Thanks to you for this valuable 1 hr discussion and thanks to the YouTube algorithm for recommending me this video."
Mr Professor,,2 years ago,3,"Your content is so invaluable bro, it's showing us the reality in the perspective of Hr. Trust me it provided immense value as i am too CS UNDERGRAD️

It would be good if you also provide links to 2 to 3 nano degrees that were being discussed."
zub c,,2 years ago (edited),0,"A very elaborate and wholesome interview, which is not only good for the IT buds (even seeds) but also for HR persons in any field. Bringing the top professionals for interviews is your forte. Helping the students in the pipeline to become good candidates is an honourous task. Sharing and سکھانا is not so common but is definitely very important. Keep up the good work!"
