I am a 1st semester student at ITU Lahore. What advice would you give to someone who started their CS journey before joining university and are currently ahead of their classmates? I think I have gotten my fundamentals right along with some OOP, I think I only need to polish my understanding and practice concepts like inheritance and polymorphism now. With that, I also love to watch random computerphile or any other good CS related video when I am free so I think I have a decent idea of what's to come. What advice would you have for me if my end goal is to land a good tech job abroad? Should I continue to stay a bit ahead or should I just go with the flow? Note that I don't plan on learning any framework or anything like that until I get my data structures right. Thanks "

I am 6th semester student of BSCS but I also have 2+ year of experience in developing iOS app with swift. Should I consider joining as a Junior iOS dev? Should my expectations be same as fresh graduate? I got diverse experience while doing freelancing. 

Also one more question, should I bring my laptop on interview?"
Ali Ahmed Khan,,1 year ago,0,"Ehmad bhai the work you are doing is making the path clear for all the CS Undergrads. Thank You! Ehmad bhai please help me wih one confusion, should I focus on making myself confident with concepts of DSA, OOP, DB or should I learn stuff like web development, android or ios ... like I know both holds importance but as an undergrad in my third year what should I focus more on.? please make a video on this many of my colleagues are confused"

Do you think getting a coursera certificate will give me a little advantage in the interviews or its fine to just have a skill without any certificate?"

I'm working as shopify dev for past 1 year and previously worked as WP dev. My problem is I almost forget all of these things and now very demotivated that how will I learn these things again. I tried many times to learn new things or grab these concepts again but nothing is helping me. I love development. It gives me confidence. But now I don't know what to do."

First of all thanks for such a great video, it covered almost every part of hiring process. 
I have a question as you methioned maybe development is not for you if you failing in technical interview.  For me i have experience and knowledge of solving any problem but I lack to get quick answer (solution) for a problem, but I noticed that when I review the code with relaxed and calm mind I get idea to solve. 
Can you please share your thoughts how to improve this."
