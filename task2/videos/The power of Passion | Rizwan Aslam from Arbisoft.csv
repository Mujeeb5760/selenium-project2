I’ve got a suggestion, I’ve noticed that most of the YouTubers have a specific time when they publish their videos which is mostly in the evening when most of the audience is available to watch immediately and the early interactions make YouTube suggest the video to more users.
Videos published early in the morning get less immediate interactions (that's what I think) and are somewhat fail to impress YouTube's algorithm.

Your videos just deserve more.

Thank you."
