I'm learning a lot of things from you. Currently in 11th grade and I'm learning React.js and Next.js along with Backend stuff. Ehmad Bhai, can you make a video on getting internships for web dev roles for high-schoolers? It would really help the new generation a lot to get real-world experience."

This truly is impactfuly and one learns many things from their one to one guidance which normally doesnt come up if I am freelancing or doing all the work myself. 

Thanks for the series @Ehmad Zubair."
