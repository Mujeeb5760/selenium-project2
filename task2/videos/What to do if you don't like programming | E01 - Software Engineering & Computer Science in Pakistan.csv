Muzamil Nawaz,,2 years ago,6,"Assalamu alaikum Ehmad Bhai,
First things first very informative content you are producing out there, I really appreciate that.
Secondly my concern is, in one of your videos you guys mentioned that reputation of ""University"" is important in our first job as Software Engineer, but let's say if we didn't get the opportunity to join best of institutions, so what's the next important things to do to overcome that lacking?
I hope I made my question clear,
Will be eagerly waiting for your insights.
Thank you ;)
Best regards,
Muzamil"

Kashif Iqbal,,2 years ago,2,"This is the most frequently asked question I heard and it also confuses me sometimes: To be a software project manager, you don't need to be a developer and then a team lead and then after 2 3 years be a project manager. I studied some blogs at PMO and there I found that you can start from 0 experience as a project manager, you just need to have a basic understanding of technology stacks and software development life cycle. In my experience I started as a business analyst then as a project coordinator and then as a project manager. My question is, is there any specific path a fresh CS grad should take if he want to build his career in software project management?"

It is true out of all, 2 steps in sdlc are corely related to programming. It is not right to say that the rest of steps are not related to programming. Because each step in sdlc is dependent on succeeding steps. Therefore, those brothers who are interested in learning something do not run away from programming. Start it now from the very basics it is not that much difficult or hard. Remember better to learn late than never. Stop wasting time."
