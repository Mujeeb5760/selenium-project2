Can you please invite someone with international experience please? Like how hard is it to get a job abroad? Is the interview process any different? Are Pakistani companies at par with international companies (Software mainly)? Thanks in advance!"

My question here is that whether by doing an Electrical Engineering degree can I still make a shift towards CS as a career, really need a guidance and roadmap for this. Regards."

Ehmad bhai thanks for making this video I was very much confused that non IT background students are accepted or not in IT companies and now I have cleared my misconceptions. I think someday I will be in your video . Mechanical engineer here now have decided to shift to IT. I am the kind of person who can build stairs in C++ with asterik.
