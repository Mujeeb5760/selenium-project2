My Question for Sad Ali

What is the difference between Jenkins and the GitLab CI/CD tool? We can set a pipeline on GitLab as well to automate the stuff like unit testing. Can we say Jenkins is an old technology nowadays or it is similar to GitLab CI/CD tools with some differences?

2nd question is that can we set some triggers on the server as well to pull the code automatically from the GitHub/Gitlab repository when the repository updated with some new code? 
I'm doing this part manually like access to the server and take the latest pull from the repository, that's why I have asked the above question.

I'll go with your suggestion about live Q&A on Instagram.

Thanks again for such amazing content."
