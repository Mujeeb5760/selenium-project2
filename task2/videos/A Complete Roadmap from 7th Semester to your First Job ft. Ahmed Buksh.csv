You have had an amazing influence on my computer science journey. God bless you. Good to see you back with long format youtube videos. Video was as informative as your videos have always been.️
Data is stunning,https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AGIKgqOrsV4Cws3U2I2TB-lYEUBIVIDtGcMoqlXof866=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj,1 month ago,0,"Ahmad bhai! You are doing a great job. Just to suggest you a topic, as now there are so many tech stacks and fields in Computer science such as Web engineering, Mobile dev, Data science, machine learning etc etc. You should do a episode on what should a student do during his degree so that he can grab a decent job."
